Check the connector checkpoint
##############################

Located at `Connectors > Connectors > Checkpoint`,
this is a list of records which have been imported
from Magento and have to be verified.

Records such as products or product categories could
have some configuration to do once they are imported,
so they appear in that list.

For each item in that list,
you can open the related record,
proceed with your configuration or verification,
and when you are done,
click on the `Reviewed` button.
