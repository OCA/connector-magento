Magento Connector
=================

This is the new release of the Open-Source connector linking Odoo and
Magento also known under the name of **Magentoerpconnect**.  It is
build on top of the `connector`_ framework. It is is structured so that
it can be extended or modified easily from separate addons, a factor of
success when the implementations of Magento vary a lot.

Magento Odoo Connector is part of the Odoo Community Association (OCA).
The `source is on GitHub`_.

This connector is designed to have a strong and efficient core, with the
ability to extend it with extension modules or local customizations.

In other words, the core module contains the minimal scope to run your
e-commerce with Odoo and Magento. More advanced features are
installable using extensions.

It features:

Synchronizations:

* Import the partners and addresses book
* Import the customer groups (becomes partner tags)
* Import the categories of products, with translations
* Import the products, with translations and main image
* Import the sales orders
* Export of the the stock quantities,
  with configuration of the warehouse and an option to choose the stock
  field to use
* Export the delivery orders status
* Export the tracking numbers
* Create the invoices on Magento and get their number back
* Resolve and import the dependencies when they are not yet imported
  (ie. customer, products for sale order)

Automatizations:

* Use the `Automatic workflows` to automatize the workflow of the sales
  according to the payment method (confirm orders, create and reconcile
  payments, ...)
* Per payment method, choose when the orders are imported
  (only when a payment is captured / authorized / always / never)
* Use the `Sales Exceptions` to prevents the processing of sales orders
  with issues

Technical points:

* Built on top of the `connector`_ framework
* Use the `connector_ecommerce`_ addon to share the e-commerce capabilities
  with other e-commerce addons
* Use the jobs system of the `connector`_ framework
* Create `connector`_ checkpoints when new records to verify are imported
* Support Magento 1.7+ (not 2.x), the support of earlier versions should be easy to
  add, the `connector`_ framework being designed to handle multiple
  versions with ease.
* Licensed under AGPL version 3
* Designed to be usable with multiple Magento or any other e-commerce backends
  in the same time.
