        Create the shipping on Magento. It can be a partial
         or a complete shipment.

        Always proceed with a complete shipment of the picking

        As it may be possible to manage partial with bundle,
        it is complex because Magento wait for the bundle item
        and not the sub-items.
        We'll have issue with a second packing which
        contains only bundle items as instance.
        In the implementation of this module,
